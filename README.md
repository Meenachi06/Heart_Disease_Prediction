# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project predicts heart disease using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. It analyzes patient data such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol to assess risk. The model helps in early detection and can be integrated with a simple user interface for predictions.
